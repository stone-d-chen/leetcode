# leetcode "easy" are not necessarily that easy

It seems like "easy" leetcode problems refers to how easy the solution is to memorize - or how "intuitive" the solution is - but IMO many of the solutions are non-trivial to prove correctness. For example Max Subarray requires Kadane's algorithm whose proof is IMO non-trivial and most solutions or explanations online don't even attempt to explain it. This makes it difficult for me to generalize strategies from one problem to another (or even memorize the solution - there's a lot of jumps in logic). This will document some solutions I find non-trivial.
